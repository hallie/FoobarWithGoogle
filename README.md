I did Google's Foobar Challenges over Thanksgiving break.

Decided to post my solutions online because why not.

NOTE: None of the names I used where the same as the actual problem.

Level 1 -
    1. Sort It
Level 2 -
    1. Find Uniq
    2. Name It
Level 3 -
    1. Hash It
    2. Snip It
    3. Zomb It
Level X - (I stopped using foobar when school started back up, so this one wasn't
              an official assignment. It was my solution to a shared problem.)
    1. Maze It

I'm not going to apologize for my function names.
